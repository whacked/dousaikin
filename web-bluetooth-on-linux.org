* getting web bluetooth on linux to work

  my test system runs on a Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga running Fedora 32:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
  lsb_release -a
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : LSB Version:	:core-4.1-amd64:core-4.1-noarch
  : Distributor ID:	Fedora
  : Description:	Fedora release 32 (Thirty Two)
  : Release:	32
  : Codename:	ThirtyTwo

  and google chrome 87:

  which according to chromestatus, bluetooth has long been supported:

  If you search directly online, you will find bunch of information which will lead you to the wrong places, although the solution is very simple. Here I document the process of finding what actually works.

  To find a working example of something that engages the web bluetooth api, find find this page: https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/demos, which links to hosted examples at https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/demos/. The first link on that page is [[https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/demos/bluetooth-led-display/][bluetooth-led-display]].

  Directly accessing the page from a Chrome family browser will quickly show whether your browser is capable of accessing the web bluetooth API. If your browser is not enabled correctly, you will see an error message:

  [[file:img/2020/11/2020-11-26_Selection_002.png]]

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    No Web Bluetooth

    The Web Bluetooth API is missing. Please enable it at chrome://flags/#enable-web-bluetooth and try again.
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  The error message's advice leads us to this configuration view in the browser:

  [[file:img/2020/11/2020-11-26_Selection_004.png]]

  which indeeds shows that there are no flags matching the name of =enable-web-bluetooth=. You may double check this is true across both the =Available= and =Unavailable= tabs. In short, *the advice is out of date*.

  Available:

  [[file:img/2020/11/2020-11-26_Selection_005.png]]
  Unavailable:

  [[file:img/2020/11/2020-11-26_Selection_006.png]]

  it turns out that the bluetooth web api is entirely bundled within =enable-experimental-web-platform-features=, which is disabled by default.
  
  [[file:img/2020/11/2020-11-26_Selection_007.png]]

  enabling this flag requires a browser restart:

  after restarting the browser, accessing the bluetooth led display demo now successfully engages querying for bluetooth devices:
