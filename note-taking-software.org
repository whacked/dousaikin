* note taking software

  it seems like we are in some kind of new wave of note taking software, particularly with notion.so and roamresearch drawing accolades, and various new open source alternatives like org-roam and athens.

  I would like to use this space to expand on some related ideas.

***** converting thought to another medium

      notation matters

      modality of thought

      - do you think in words?
      - do you think in pictures?
      - proprioception
      - limits of perception
        - color blindedness
        - aphantasia
        - tone deafness
        - spatial orientation / sense of direction
        - absolute vs relative
        - other senses:
          - taste
          - smell
          - starry starry night
      - music: hum, strum, record the tune
        - sheet music
        - and the limits of auditory memory?

      so, text is one form of the medium
      
      then there are images
      
      the clipboard gives you a ready-made representation

      these things are generally self-indexing

      but for novel ideas, you're back to text

      hopefully you are a good writer, have a good arsenal of of precise vocabulary!

      let me describe my coffee to you
      - nutty
      - bold
      - full-bodied
      - fruity
      - caramel
      - buttery
      - chocolate overtones
      - buckets of cherry
      - whispers of autumn
      - serpents and liquid lipids
        
      when you're in the wrong modality, you're approximating using your current set of tools. when your set of tools (such as your command of the language) does not provide a good translation across the modality boundary, that will be the limit of the information you preserve!
      
***** the exception: perfect recall

      - people who never forget (that article)
      - even people who never forget /need a cue/

      you are thus recording /cues/, among other things

      but then it is important to keep in mind what purpose does your current writing serve:
      - I am planning a project (goal-oriented planning)
      - I am preparing for a speech (content organization)
      - I am trying to record what the teacher is saying (information dump)
      - I am recording a thought (thought stream, information dump)
      - I am recording a sensation (cross modal memory cue)
      
***** the second exception: exceptional recall

      - kim peek
      - eliezer yudkowsky
      - stephen wolfram
      - harold bloom
      - john von neumann
      - christopher hitchens
      - homer

      since you are reading this, you are neither Eliezer Yudkowsky, Stephen Wolfram, nor Kim Peek

* the cognitive mechanisms of association

** recall is the first issue

*** post it notes, on the desktop

** associative recall is a tangential issue

** the claim of serendipity and creativity

   - when is a deliberately maintained association a "good" association?
     - is it good, if it's overtly related?
       - projects -- fragrances -- flowers -- spices -- cooking -- alchemy -- medieval stories -- knights and dragons
     - is it better, if it's a more surprising jump?
       - fragrances and dragons

* refined thought comes through pruning

  there are 2 processes generally known as "exploration and exploitation" in optimization processes; thought refinement is no exception.

  exploration, brainstorming, thought-streaming, idea collecting, and such: allow any potential linkages of thought for consideration

  exploitation in thought is entirely a /pruning/ process.

  - well-established studies of experts displaying less brain activation in tasks within their domains of expertise
  - studies of participants showing decreased brain activation over time commensurate with expertise
  - the faster the learner, the faster the decrease

  for any thought-oriented tool, there are thus 2 phases of thought refinement. Most tools only deal with accumulation. Establishing "richer" thought associations is further along the direction of accumulation: in fact, it explosively increases complexity, but is saved by the implicit biological process of /your/ brain doing its job of long-term reorganization and reinterpretation that happens in your subconsciousness.

* personal knowledge graph

  

* practical considerations

  what dimensions should you care about?

  - latency
  - long term preservability
  - robustness and backup
  - format interoperability
  - your notes are always yours
  - storage limits
  - conflict resolution
  - is collaboration overrated for you?
    - group recall is different from personal recall
    - the case of the lowest common denominator and the Google Docs index

** spatial information and the mind's canvas

   a truly associative support system must be multi-modal

   spatial information must have permanence
