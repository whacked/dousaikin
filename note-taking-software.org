* note taking software

  it seems like we are in some kind of new wave of note taking software, particularly with notion.so and roamresearch drawing accolades, and various new open source alternatives like org-roam and athens.

  I would like to use this space to expand on some related ideas.

* associative note taking

** prior art

*** wikis

**** c2

**** mediawiki (wikipedia)

**** all the other clones

**** tiddlywiki

**** zim

*** plain text editors and derivatives

    and how everybody invents a new format

**** vanilla plain text

***** and then you impose structure

***** free form is still king

**** markdown family

**** org-mode

**** vnd/tiddlywiki

*** it's about the speed

**** notational velocity family

**** google search and suggestions

**** auto-complete

**** address bar evolution and autocomplete

**** did you mean...
     
***** as a search fix

***** in command line applications

****** pip

****** node

* the cognitive mechanisms of association

** recall is the first issue

** associative recall is a tangential issue

** the claim of serendipity and creativity

* methods of representing association

** hierarchies (folders and files)

** tags

** transclusion
