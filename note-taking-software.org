* note taking software

  it seems like we are in some kind of new wave of note taking software, particularly with notion.so and roamresearch drawing accolades, and various new open source alternatives like org-roam and athens.

  I would like to use this space to expand on some related ideas.

* associative note taking

** prior art

*** wikis

**** c2

**** mediawiki (wikipedia)

**** all the other clones

**** tiddlywiki

**** zim

*** plain text editors and derivatives

    and how everybody invents a new format

**** vanilla plain text

***** and then you impose structure

***** free form is still king

**** markdown family

**** org-mode

**** vnd/tiddlywiki

** ergonomics

*** it's about the speed

    the barrier between the thought and the (permanent medium)

**** transformation cost (or impedance mismatch)

***** converting thought to another medium

      notation matters

      modality of thought

      - do you think in words?
      - do you think in pictures?
      - proprioception
      - limits of perception
        - color blindedness
        - aphantasia
        - tone deafness
        - spatial orientation / sense of direction
        - absolute vs relative
        - other senses:
          - taste
          - smell
          - starry starry night
      - music: hum, strum, record the tune
        - sheet music
        - and the limits of auditory memory?

      so, text is one form of the medium
      
      then there are images
      
      the clipboard gives you a ready-made representation

      these things are generally self-indexing

      but for novel ideas, you're back to text

      hopefully you are a good writer, have a good arsenal of of precise vocabulary!

      let me describe my coffee to you
      - nutty
      - bold
      - full-bodied
      - fruity
      - caramel
      - buttery
      - chocolate overtones
      - buckets of cherry
      - whispers of autumn
      - serpents and liquid lipids
        
      when you're in the wrong modality, you're approximating using your current set of tools. when your set of tools (such as your command of the language) does not provide a good translation across the modality boundary, that will be the limit of the information you preserve!
      
***** the exception: perfect recall

      - people who never forget
      - even people who never forget /need a cue/

      you are thus recording /cues/, among other things

      but then it is important to keep in mind what purpose does your current writing serve:
      - I am planning a project (goal-oriented planning)
      - I am preparing for a speech (content organization)
      - I am trying to record what the teacher is saying (information dump)
      - I am recording a thought (thought stream, information dump)
      - I am recording a sensation (cross modal memory cue)
      
**** notational velocity family

**** google search and suggestions

**** auto-complete

**** address bar evolution and autocomplete

**** did you mean...
     
***** as a search fix

***** in command line applications

****** pip

****** node

* the cognitive mechanisms of association

** recall is the first issue

** associative recall is a tangential issue

** the claim of serendipity and creativity

* methods of representing association

** hierarchies (folders and files)

** tags

*** tags vs folders and the case of gmail

** transclusion and other forms of "unitary association"
